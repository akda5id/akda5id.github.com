W. Daniel Hillis for Physics Today <a href="http://www.longnow.org/views/essays/articles/ArtFeynman.php">at The Long Now Foundation</a>:
<blockquote>
One day when I was having lunch with Richard Feynman, I mentioned to him that I was planning to start a company to build a parallel computer with a million processors. His reaction was unequivocal, "That is positively the dopiest idea I ever heard." For Richard a crazy idea was an opportunity to either prove it wrong or prove it right. Either way, he was interested. By the end of lunch he had agreed to spend the summer working at the company.
