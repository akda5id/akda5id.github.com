<blockquote>I've been inspired to take a trip back through the archives here to see where we've been since January 2007. I'll start with January, then do each month in a separate post. So if you're new to BLDGBLOG, or even if you've been here all along, since our rather quiet start back in 2004, here's a relatively good way to see what the site is all about.</blockquote>
