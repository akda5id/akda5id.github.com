That's Reiser of ReiserFS. I could care less, except it prompted <a href="http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?s=&threadid=2113601#post316384891">Auslander</a> to point out that if the brains of ReiserFS is behind bars, you might get a situation where
<blockquote>a bunch of kernel committers [are] trying to get information about FS design out of hans while he serves his prison term. Something like a dorktabulous "Silence of The Lambs" comes to mind.</blockquote>
