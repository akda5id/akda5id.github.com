<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2008/11/24/What-Sun-Should-Do" title="ongoing &#xb7; What Sun Should Do">Tim Bray</a> on Sun:
<blockquote>Sun is going through a lousy spell right now. Well, so is the worldâ€™s economy in general and the IT business in particular, but this is about Sun. This is my opinion about what my employer should do about it. [. . .] Sun should adopt a laser focus on building a Sun Web Suite and becoming the Web application deployment platform of choice. Itâ€™s a large space, a growing space, and one where we can win.</blockquote>

He is obviously absolutely right, there is no place for the old Sun in this world. However Sun does have some excellent tech, and importantly they seem to still have a lot of top engineers, so if they can manage a major restructuring they have a fighting chance.
