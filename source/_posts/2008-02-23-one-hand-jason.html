<a href="http://www.bmezine.com/news/pubring/20080219.html">Interview at BME with "One Hand Jason"</a>:

<blockquote>Iâ€™m one of those body-integrity-disorder (BIID) dudes. As long as I can remember, having two hands was a defect in my body â€” something that was not meant to be. For me philosophically, itâ€™s totally different from body mods, which I also have. I donâ€™t think I had any choice. My right hand just didnâ€™t belong to my body.</blockquote>
