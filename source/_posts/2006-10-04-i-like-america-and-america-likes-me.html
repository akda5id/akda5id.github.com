<a href="http://www.theworld.org/wma.php?id=10045">A 5min bit</a> on BBC's The World, reporting on the [corporate] censorship of Jonathan Hexner's video art piece "I Like America and America Likes Me" which was to be displayed on the Axel Springer building in Berlin. You can view the video piece <a href="http://www.theworld.org/audio/jhex.mov">on The World's website</a> (you might want to download that and play in quicktime unless you have a browser window wider than 2016px).
