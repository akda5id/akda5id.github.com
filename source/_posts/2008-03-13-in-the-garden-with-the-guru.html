Bob Rodgers essay in <a href="http://lrc.reviewcanada.ca/index.php?page=In-the-Garden-with-the-Guru">Literary Review of Canada</a>:
<blockquote>A six-foot-high hedge separated me from the garden next door but not from its voices. It was my first Sunday morning in the house I sublet on Wells Hill Avenue by Casa Loma in Toronto. I couldnâ€™t make out what was being said but one of the voices sounded familiar. I moved closer and parted the hedge just enough for a covert glimpse of my new neighbours. A middle-aged man was lying on his back in a hammock with a book held up vertically above his head as he read aloud. Next to him a young man sat in a deck chair with a book on his lap. The young man said: â€œVicoâ€™s cycles.â€ The older man said: â€œVicious Circles.â€ â€œViscous cyclones,â€œ said the young man. I was awestruck. My God, I thought, I must be the only person in the world at this moment listening to what looks like a tag team reading Finnegans Wake. Later I learned I had been witness to a regular occurrence. Eric McLuhan and his father, Marshall, were reading at each other.</blockquote>
