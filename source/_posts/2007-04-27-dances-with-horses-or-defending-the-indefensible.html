One of the better introductions to "Zoo" that I have read, though the interview is pretty lame (not the writers fault, heh)

<blockquote>I can understand anybody's reluctance to engage with the issues raised in "Zoo," a lovely, subdued film, washed in midnight blue, that flirts with the outer edges of documentary reconstruction and poetic license -- and is certain to make you uncomfortable. But much of the outraged response to "Zoo," almost all of it from people who haven't seen the film (I heard a lot of this myself, after covering it at Sundance), is based on willful ignorance and incomprehension.</blockquote>
