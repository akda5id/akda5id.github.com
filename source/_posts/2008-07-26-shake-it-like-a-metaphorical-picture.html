<blockquote>
Sometime next year, Polaroid will stop producing instant film. There have been lots of people jumping in to help save the format, and others writing some striking eulogies, as the rest of us start mourning the oncoming loss. But one thing I canâ€™t quite shake is what Polaroid represents to me, something that will likely be on its way out the door too: the visual metaphor of a photograph.
