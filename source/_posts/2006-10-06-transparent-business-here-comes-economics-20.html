I am reading <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerando_%28novel%29">Accelerando</a></i> by Charles Stross. It is a deeply flawed look at the post singularity world, but I am prepared to forgive it it's flaws due to the fact that to look beyond the beyond is impossible (the definition of singularity strongly relates to the inability to understand). Anyhow one of the most interesting parts of the book is the poking at what a truly efficient economy would be, and what happens when tech makes that posable.

Now the SEC is going to push the first step into giving AI's the data to run the stock market :gonk::

<blockquote>I spent a couple of fascinating hours Tuesday at a round table hosted by the United States <a href="http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2006/2006-166.htm">Securities and Exchange Commission</a>.  The subject was <a href="http://www.sec.gov/spotlight/xbrl.htm">Interactive Data</a>, a term which is hardly self-explanatory but really means "Business Transparency". This in the same week that Jonathan  <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/entry/one_small_step_for_the">sent a letter</a> on the same subject to SEC Chairman <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/10/04/SEC">Christopher Cox</a>, who was also around the table. Mr. Cox and the SEC are definitely on the right track; I expect bumps in the road, but there's a chance that Accounting As We Know It could be blown up. Which would be a good thing; and not just because Open Source is creeping in.</blockquote>

(I am kidding about the :gonk: bit, this is pretty cool, and will help us humans "keep the thieves out" as Tim says. Just don't let the computers take over man, man.)
