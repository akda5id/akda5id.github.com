<blockquote>The coverage of the current US primaries is mindbogglingly wrongheaded. Recent coverage has focused on who would 'win' New Hampshire among the democrats, and Huckabee's 'lead' among republicans. The actual numbers can be found <a href="http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/">here</a>. New Hampshire is <b>not</b> a winner-take-all state for democrats, and both Clinton and Obama got exactly nine delegates from there, making the declaration of a 'winner' extremely misleading, if not outright revealing of the declarer having dubious mental capacity. Among republicans, Mitt Romney now has the most delegates, with Huckabee in second, and the media is currently speculating that Romney will drop out because he's so far 'behind'.<br /><br />Seriously, what is wrong with journalists? Are they not able to do basic arithmetic? Ideally I'd like to have meta-coverage discussing why some states are winner take all and others aren't, and what on earth 'super-delegates' are, but I'd settle for even an accurate portrayal of what's happening in the race as it unfolds.<br /><br />But thank you CNN for putting up a nice site which gives accurate up-to-date information. Please expand it in the future with more explanation of what 'super delegates' are, and what happens to a candidate's delegates if they drop out of the race.</blockquote>
