"It's the business of killing trees and putting chemicals on them."

"Baseball cards that suck in energy and run e-ink animated displays"

"They're not hiding, they're just selective."

"We help companies put together arguments and stories to win that venture money."

"Those Austrian farm-boys didn't know that ink-plants were supposed to be messy, so that was one of the cleanest plants they ever had."

"Electronic cardboard blurs the line between printed objects and the virtual world."

"The supply chain is a network of atoms."

"Six trillion RFID tags is four orders of magnitude bigger than any electronic item ever made."

"You can't take on the Silicon Gorilla face to face."
