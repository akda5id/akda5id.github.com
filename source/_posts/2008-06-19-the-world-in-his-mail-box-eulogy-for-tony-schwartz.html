<blockquote>Recorded sound had no greater friend than Tony Schwartz, the audio documentarian, advertising guru, media consultant, and exalted citizen of the aural universe, who passed away Saturday a few months shy of his 85th birthday. He'll be forever linked to his best-known workâ€”the infamous "Daisy" ad from Lyndon Johnson's 1964 re-election campaignâ€”but to many, Schwartz is beloved for sharing with the world his lifelong infatuation with the musicality of prosaic sounds.</blockquote> And Doug posted some great clips from his albums, go listen.
