<blockquote>In a recent study, professor of psychiatry Harrison Pope, co-director of the Biological Psychiatry Lab at Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital, put â€œrepressed memoryâ€ to the test of time. He reasoned that if dissociative amnesia were an innate capability of the brainâ€”akin to depression, hallucinations, anxiety, and dementiaâ€”it would appear in written works throughout history. In collaboration with associate professor of psychiatry James Hudson, Michael Parker, a professor of English at the U.S. Naval Academy, Michael Poliakoff, director of education programs at the National Endowment for the Humanities, and research assistant Matthew Boynes, Pope set out to find the earliest recorded example of a â€œrepressed memory.â€</blockquote>
