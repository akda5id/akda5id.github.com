Andrew Blum:
<blockquote>â€œI think weâ€™re not too far off from recognizing that itâ€™s a moral imperative to add density to any place with a transit stop,â€ believes Christopher Leinberger, a fellow at the Brookings Institutionâ€”displaying plenty of the modernist brio and contempt for the souls of cities that Jacobs fought. But Iâ€™m tending to agree. We are wedging ourselves between a rock and a hard place: between the pleasures of medium-density living (Greenwich Village, Park Slope, Torontoâ€™s Annex) and the ecological necessity of even more density. When it comes to our homes, we are all justifiably afraid of change, especially when it feels like (or is) destruction. But we donâ€™t often pair that truth with another oft-repeated one: Our way of life is unsustainable. In North Americaâ€™s most beautiful urban places, we unfailingly fight every new tall building in the name of â€œquality of lifeâ€ and the â€œcharacter of the neighborhood.â€ We claim to have internalized the idea that itâ€™s all connected, that slowing the warming of the planet is a global project, but the nature in our backyards remains sacredâ€”often to the point, perhaps, of self-destruction.</blockquote>

The key question is how to keep the neighborhood even in high density living. Take a look at cities that have naturally grown with high density, like Hong Kong, and you will see it is possible.
