<blockquote>â€œI remember when I was a kid,â€ Pelletier explains in the text within the brochure, â€œthere was a rumour â€“ I donâ€™t know if it was true - that at McDonalds, the benches were made so that you wouldnâ€™t spend too much time there.â€ It was from that thought the idea for the Slightly Uncomfortable Chair Collection (SUCC) came.</blockquote>
