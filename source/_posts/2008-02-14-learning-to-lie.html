<blockquote>It starts very young. Indeed, bright kidsâ€”those who do better on other academic indicatorsâ€”are able to start lying at 2 or 3. â€œLying is related to intelligence,â€ explains Dr. Victoria Talwar, an assistant professor at Montrealâ€™s McGill University and a leading expert on childrenâ€™s lying behavior.

Although we think of truthfulness as a young childâ€™s paramount virtue, it turns out that lying is the more advanced skill. A child who is going to lie must recognize the truth, intellectually conceive of an alternate reality, and be able to convincingly sell that new reality to someone else. Therefore, lying demands both advanced cognitive development and social skills that honesty simply doesnâ€™t require. â€œItâ€™s a developmental milestone,â€ Talwar has concluded.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The most disturbing reason children lie is that parents teach them to. According to Talwar, they learn it from us. â€œWe donâ€™t explicitly tell them to lie, but they see us do it. They see us tell the telemarketer, â€˜Iâ€™m just a guest here.â€™ They see us boast and lie to smooth social relationships.â€

Consider how we expect a child to act when he opens a gift he doesnâ€™t like. We instruct him to swallow all his honest reactions and put on a polite smile. Talwar runs an experiment where children play games to win a present, but when they finally receive the present, itâ€™s a lousy bar of soap. After giving the kids a moment to overcome the shock, a researcher asks them how they like it. About a quarter of preschoolers can lie that they like the giftâ€”by elementary school, about half.</blockquote>
