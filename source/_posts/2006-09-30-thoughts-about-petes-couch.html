<p class="firstinpost">This <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2150334/"><i>Slate</i> article</a> about the federal Office of National Drug Control Policy's new anti-marijuana ad, "Pete's Couch" prompts the following question: If one of the greatest harms of marijuana use is that it makes you lazy -- as one would expect it to be if the federal government is producing ads about it -- why is marijuana use a criminal offense?</p>
