<blockquote>Down in Antarctica, November marks the end of spring, the beginning of austral summer, and the beginning of Antarctica's cruise season. The Sun just rose for the first time in 6 months on September 22nd, and is now visible in the sky all the time. Recent studies in Antarctica have brought new insights into the origins of deep sea octopus species (a 30 million-year-old ancestor from Antarctic waters), volcanic contributions to disappearing antarctic ice, and the effects of increasing numbers of icebergs scouring the seafloor. <a href="http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/2008/11/scenes_from_antarctica.html" title="Scenes from Antarctica  - The Big Picture - Boston.com">Collected here</a> are 32 photographs of Antarctica from the past several years.
