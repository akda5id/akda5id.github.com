<blockquote>Ever since v-2.org went down for the count, I get a fair number of requests to repost this minifesto on â€œopen-source constitutions for post-national entitites,â€ from 2003. Itâ€™s goofy, itâ€™s naÃ¯ve, itâ€™s grandiose and pompousâ€¦and I present it to you now exactly as I wrote it then. Enjoy!</blockquote>
