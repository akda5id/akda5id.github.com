Went to the Tokyo Metropolitan Museum of Photography yesterday, and saw two of my favorite photos ever, and a contender for #3. They apparently own an amazing collection, many of my favorites were theirs.

Can't find anything by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keiichir%C5%8D_Got%C5%8D">KeiichirÅ GotÅ</a> online, but his "Displaced History" is my new number 1. Saw a really good print of Bill Brant's "Portrait of Young Girl, Eaton Place, 1955"

The other was from Mario Giacomelli's "There are no hands to caress my face" series, a cropped to a very wide format shot of 3 seminarians compressed from background to foreground looking at a kitten climbing a tree.
