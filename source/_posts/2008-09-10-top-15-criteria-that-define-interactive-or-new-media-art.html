<blockquote>The Near Future Laboratory Top-15 Criteria for New or Interactive Media Art are...

15. It doesn't work

14. It doesn't work because you couldn't get a hold of a 220-to-110 volt converter/110-to-220 volt converter/PAL-to-NTSC/NTSC-to-PAL scan converter/serial-to-usb adapter/"dongle" of any sort..and the town you're in is simply not the kind of place that has/cares about such things

13. Your audience looks under/behind your table/pedestal/false wall/drop ceiling or follows wires to find out "where the camera is"

12. Someone either on their blog or across the room is prattling on about the shifting relations between producers and consumers..and mentions your project

11. Your audience "interacts" by clapping/hooting/making bird calls/flapping their arms like a duck or waving their arms wildly while standing in front of a wall onto which is projected squiggly lines

10. Your audience asks amongst themselves, "how does it work?"

9. The exhibition curators insist that you spend hours standing by your own wall text so that you can explain to attendees "how it works"

8. It's just like using your own normal, human, perfectly good eyeballs, only the resolution sucks and the colors are really lousy..plus the heat from the CPU fan is blowing on your forehead which makes you really uncomfortable and schvitz-y

7. Someone in your audience wearing a Crumpler bag, slinging a fancy digital SLR and/or standing with their arms folded smugly says, "Yeah..yeah, I could've done that too..c'mon dude..some Perlin Noise? And Processing/Ruby-on-Rails/AJAX/Blue LEDs/MaxMSP/An Infrared Camera/Lots of Free Time/etc.? Pfft..It's so easy..."

6. Someone in your audience, maybe the same guy with the Crumpler bag and digital SLR excitedly says, "Oh, dude. That should totally be a Facebook app!"

5. It's called a "project" and not a "piece of art"

4. You saw the "project" years ago...and here it is again...now with multi-touch interaction and other fancy digital bells and Web 2.0-y whistles

3. Your audience cups their hands over various proturbances/orifices at or nearby your project attempting to confuse/interact with the camera/sensor/laser beam, even if it uses no such technology

2. There's a noticeable preponderance of smoothly shifting red, green and blue lighting effects

1. People wonder if it wasn't all really done in Photoshop, anyway</blockquote>
