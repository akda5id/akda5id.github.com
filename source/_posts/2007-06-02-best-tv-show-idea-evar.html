<blockquote><p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6699847.stm">A Dutch TV station says it will go ahead with a programme in which a terminally ill woman selects one of three patients to receive her kidneys. </a>  Political parties have called for The Big Donor Show to be scrapped, but broadcaster BNN says it will highlight the countryâ€™s shortage of organ donors.  The programme, from Big Brother creators Endemol, is due to be screened on Friday night.</p></blockquote>

Update: It was <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6714063.stm">a hoax</a>. Too bad.
