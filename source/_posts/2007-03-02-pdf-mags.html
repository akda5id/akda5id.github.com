<blockquote>Jean Snow just sent me this.  The few moments in the week that I call my spare time have just been obliterated.  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pdf-mags.com/">pdf-mags.com - an aggregator for PDF magazines.</a>

I am utterly screwed.  But isnâ€™t it wonderful?  I love that I can now pull down a free magazine stuffed with 56 pages of stencil art from Kiev.

(Thereâ€™s also a smaller <a href="http://www.scrnmgs.com/">scrnmgs</a> for Flash-driven online magazines.)</blockquote>
