Update: Links to all the media available <a href="http://www.ideaconference.org/blog/?p=46">here</a>. Read on for the ones I think are best.

Some interesting talks from <a href="http://ideaconference.org/program.html">Idea2006</a>, ranked in order that I imagine my audience will appreciate them. All the media is <a href="http://vex.ubernerd.org/idea2006/">here</a>.

Dan Hill: The New Media
<blockquote>Drawing from work in both strategic and operational areas at the BBC in London, Iâ€™ll explore some of the ways big media companies are approaching the new media landscape. Far from being marginalised by Web 2.0-style operations, Iâ€™ll argue that broadcast media can be reinvented to take advantage of both its traditional strengths and the new environment it finds itself in. Iâ€™ll highlight the course weâ€™re plotting between between the top-down, fully-articulated, designed, broadcast models and the fully-participative, emergent, vernacular, open-ended, networked models. Essentially believing there is some value in both, and lots in their potential fusion. This will include examples of strategic work defining the design and navigation principles around the next generation BBC website as well as tactical steps towards this, drawn from interactive products and services made at BBC Radio & Music. This will include using hosting music festivals in Second Life, explorations of â€˜Lostâ€™ mapped onto graphical scores, spurious relationships between urban planning and designing media systems and tricks for getting design â€˜into the boardroomâ€™.</blockquote>

Paul Gould: Next Generation Libraries

God, what a stuck up prick, but he did have some interesting things to say. <a href="http://vex.ubernerd.org/idea2006/19%20Paul%20Gould%20-%20Next%20Generation%20Libraries%20part%203.mp3">Audio</a>, <a href="http://vex.ubernerd.org/idea2006/19_maya_idea_conference_oct_2006_nomovies_png.zip">slides</a>.

Linda Stone: Opening Keynote

<blockquote>Designers have a special sensitivity and resonance with mass consciousness. Linda Stone has studied how the way we use our attention impacts and is impacted by mass consciousness. From multi-tasking, to what Stone calls, â€œcontinuous partial attention,â€ to focus and uni-tasking, Stone tracks twenty year social cycles, bringing a sense of context to our current, always-on lifestyle.</blockquote>

And the closing keynote from Bruce Sterling, a little less than I have come to expect from his usually brilliant summations, but still fun: <a href="http://vex.ubernerd.org/idea2006/22%20Bruce%20Sterling%20-%20Closing%20Keynote.mp3">Audio</a>.

I was fairly delirious through the first day due to being awake 48 hours at that point, so if you find anything else good let me know, and I will listen to it, heh.
