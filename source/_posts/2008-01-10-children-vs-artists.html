<blockquote>As a parent, I can attest to the wild imagination of children. I was a kid once too, and I remember. <a href="http://www.themonsterengine.com/art.html">David Devries</a> from South Orange New Jersey remembers too and transforms the drawings of children - with their wild imaginations for conjuring up monsters, superheros and creatures - into "adult" versions of their art.</blockquote>
