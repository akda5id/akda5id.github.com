<blockquote>With PlayStation dad Ken Kutaragi taking home the Lifetime Achievement Award at DICE this year, there's one achievement of his that isn't in the list of honors: His ability to come up with amazingly insane sound bites. Just a few:

(On PS3's price) "It's probably too cheap."

(On PS3's price) "We want consumers to think to themselves 'I will work more hours to buy one.'"

(On PS2's tech) "Same interface. Same concept. Starting from next year, you can jack into The Matrix!"</blockquote>
