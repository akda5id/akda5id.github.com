<blockquote>I called Rafael Corazza, director of the Competition Commission, to ask what he was thinking. â€œItâ€™s not normal for one market to have special regulations,â€ he explained. â€œIt was a cartel. The German and Swiss booksellers said it was for a good purpose â€” they made a cultural argument, but we are an economic commission. They said the system fosters a broader, deeper market for books, that discounting will hurt the small booksellers who support the small publishers, and then you will have fewer books and more focus on best sellers.â€

Are they right? I asked.

â€œIâ€™m not quite sure theyâ€™re completely wrong,â€ he said. â€œNobody knows for sure yet. But nobody can read one million titles, so the question is, is it better that more people read fewer books or that fewer people read a lot of different books?â€
