The conclusion:
<blockquote>Nobu, the young salaryman, likes his job but plans to start his own business one day. The older men in his office struck compromises that he is not prepared to endure. â€œAfter 1945, we were left with nothing, so we had to work together, with the same goal and as one team. We were a success, and Japan grew,â€ he says. â€œBut this organisation doesn't work any more. It has stayed the same for too long. The system has rusted.â€</blockquote>
