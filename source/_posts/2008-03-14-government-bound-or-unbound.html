Anthony de Jasay <a href="http://www.cato-unbound.org/2008/02/11/anthony-de-jasay/government-bound-or-unbound/">at Cato Unbound</a>:
<blockquote>This paper is a sequel of an article I wrote twenty years ago that I now think can be put more tightly and clearly. That early paper was born of the irritation I felt, and continue to feel, at much of the classical liberal discourse about limited government. At least since Locke, that discourse sets out a normative ideal of government: the protector of â€œrightsâ€ its citizens are in some fashion endowed with, and the guarantor of liberty that ranks above rival values. Such government uses coercion only to enforce the rules of just conduct. This ideal is attractive enough to the liberal mind. The reason why it nevertheless irritates is that it makes it seem that the writing of a constitution of liberty is a plausible means for transforming the normative ideal into positive reality. The message is that â€œweâ€ can have limited government in the above sense if only â€œweâ€ understand why we ought to wish it. The â€œweâ€ is crucial, for it suppresses the essence of collective choice. Collective choice starts where unanimity ends, and involves some deciding for all, where the â€œsomeâ€ control the apparatus of government. It is the potential for some to benefit morally and materially at the expense of others that creates the bone of contention and that limits on government are meant to move out of reach. It is odd that little or no awareness is shown of the â€œincentive-incompatibilityâ€ (if we may use ugly but handy jargon) of limits that would exert real rather than illusory restraint.</blockquote>

Fairly simple and easy to read look at the impossibility of legislatively constraining government, and on the other hand the natural economic limits that do constrain all governments (though in a painfully wide band that they can and do tend to oscillate in).
