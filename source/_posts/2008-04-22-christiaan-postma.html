<blockquote>
The starting point with this project was a personal study about form & time. I put together more than 150 individual clockworks and made them work together to become one clock.  I show the progress of time by letting the numbers be written in words by the clockworks. Reading clockwise,  the time being is visible through a word and readable by the completeness of the word, 12 words from â€œoneâ€ to â€œtwelveâ€.</blockquote>
