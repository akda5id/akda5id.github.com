Authors sign bad contract for 10% of net rather than usual 15% of gross, get screwed by publisher selling at cost, and then pull out this wonder:
<blockquote>
â€œIt suddenly occurred to us that Regnery is making collectively jillions of dollars off of us and paying us a pittance.â€ He added: â€œWhy is Regnery acting like a Marxist cartoon of a capitalist company?â€
</blockquote>

And might this have something to do with it?
<blockquote>â€œThese guys created the conservative book market,â€ Mr. Mowbray said. â€œBefore them, conservatives were having to fight, generally unsuccessfully, to get books published.â€</blockquote>
