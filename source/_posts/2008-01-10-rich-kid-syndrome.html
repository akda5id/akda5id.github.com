<blockquote>In 2000, there were 7,000 American households worth $100 million or more; in 2003, there were 10,000; and today, though the data isnâ€™t yet in, Boston College estimates that the number will be 14,000 or 15,000, or double what it was at the beginning of the millennium. If you pare back the standard from eight zeroes to seven, the numbers are even more surprising: Boston College has calculated that in 2004, the last time the Fed provided data, there were 649,000 American households worth $10 million or more, a nearly 300 percent jump since 1992. [. . .]

At some point, the offspring of this charmed class will be the stewards of the dollhouse nation their parents have createdâ€”and, more important, the caretakers of its treasury. Already, Boston College projects that inheritances received between 2003 and 2007 will be 50 percent larger than those received between 1998 and 2002, and thatâ€™s after adjusting for inflation.</blockquote>
