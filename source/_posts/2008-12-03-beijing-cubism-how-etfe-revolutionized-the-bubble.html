<blockquote>ETFE is temperature-resistant, lightweight (1/100th the weight of glass), recyclable, non-toxic when exposed to flame (it actually shrinks away from heat, thus helping to vent smoke out of a burning building), highly insulative, non-porous, and non-stick. Even better, its high-tensile strength makes it easy to manipulateâ€”it can be spun into thin sheets for ease of transport then inflated on-site to create the "pillow" effect of the Aquatics Center walls. It can also be finished in varying degrees of translucenceâ€”as transparent as glass or opaque as glass bricks.</blockquote>
