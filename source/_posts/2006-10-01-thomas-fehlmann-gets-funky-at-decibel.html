Thomas Fehlmann shakes his cute German booty during a live dub set: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdqEtW7LRSk">one</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Al22jVY_ZRU">two</a>.
One of the best shows of my life, the energy he brought was great.

The whole Decibel weekend was awesome, check out more videos by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/profile_videos?user=basicsounds">basicsounds here</a>, or his <a href="http://basic_sounds.blogspot.com/2006_09_24_basic_sounds_archive.html#115965786647042634">blog post</a> where he says Decibel was better then Mutek (he is Canadian even!).

Make sure to watch the Ryoichi Kurokawa videos <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTMEU7xxep4">one</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVy0ouob7uQ">two</a>. That shit blew my mind.

Also Andreas Tilliander <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiAkNVS7xYg">at the after-party</a> Sunday morning. I felt like I was back in Berlin, Seattle still partying at 7am? This was regarded as the best set of the weekend but I was too fucking dog tired to enjoy it.
