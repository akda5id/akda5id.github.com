<blockquote>In the last ten years or so the trumpet has been enjoying a renaissance. There are a number of gifted and innovative trumpet players the world over deconstructing, reinventing and rethinking the instrument in myriad ways. In the '80s when John Zorn was doing mouthpiece-only duck calls and blowing his sax into a bucket of water, the trumpeters were still playing somewhat straight. I suppose it was only a matter of time. What follows is a sample of the breadth of solo trumpet sounds percolating away.</blockquote>

I hate "new jazz". This is not new jazz, this is some great experimental music. Be sure to check the Mazen Kerbaj as well as Peter Evans.
