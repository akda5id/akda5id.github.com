    <content type="html"><![CDATA[James Howard Kunstler on his excellently titled blog <a href="http://kunstler.com/blog/2009/12/forecast-2010.html">Clusterfuck Nation</a>:

<blockquote>One wild card is how angry the American people might get.  Unlike the 1930s, we are no longer a nation who call each other &#8220;Mister&#8221; and &#8220;Ma&#8217;am,&#8221; where even the down-and-out wear neckties and speak a discernible variant of regular English, where hoboes say &#8220;thank you,&#8221; and where, in short, there is something like a common culture of shared values.  We&#8217;re a nation of thugs and louts with flames tattooed on our necks, who call each other &#8220;motherfucker&#8221; and are skilled only in playing video games based on mass murder. The masses of Roosevelt&#8217;s time were coming off decades of programmed, regimented work, where people showed up in well-run factories and schools and pretty much behaved themselves. In my view, that&#8217;s one of the reasons that the US didn&#8217;t explode in political violence during the Great Depression of the 1930s - the discipline and fortitude of the citizenry.  The sheer weight of demoralization now is so titanic that it is very hard to imagine the people of the USA pulling together for anything beyond the most superficial ceremonies - placing teddy bears on a crash site.  And forget about discipline and fortitude in a nation of ADD victims and self-esteem seekers.</blockquote>

<blockquote>If youâ€™ve ever had a good, long look at the human phallus, whether yours or someone elseâ€™s, youâ€™ve probably scratched your head over such a peculiarly shaped device. Letâ€™s face itâ€”itâ€™s not the most intuitively shaped appendage in all of evolution. But according to evolutionary psychologist Gordon Gallup of the State University of New York at Albany, the human penis is actually an impressive â€œtoolâ€ in the truest sense of the word, one manufactured by nature over hundreds of thousands of years of human evolution. You may be surprised to discover just how highly specialized a tool it is. Furthermore, youâ€™d be amazed at what its appearance can tell us about the nature of our sexuality.</blockquote>

&#8220;Little Boy&#8221; (Hiroshima Atomic Bomb) 1945

Nice set of black and white (and infrared?) photos of cold war era Weapons of Mass Destruction.

See also: <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/12/15/081215fa_fact_samuels?printable=true" title="A Reporter at Large: Atomic John: Reporting & Essays: The New Yorker">&#8220;Atomic John&#8221; in The New Yorker</a>
<blockquote>The single, blinding release of pure energy over Hiroshima, Japan, on August 6, 1945, marked a startling and permanent break with our prior understandings of the visible world. Yet for more than sixty years the technology behind the explosion has remained a state secret.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The most accurate account of the bombâ€™s inner workingsâ€”an unnervingly detailed reconstruction, based on old photographs and documentsâ€”has been written by a sixty-one-year-old truck driver from Waukesha, Wisconsin, named John Coster-Mullen, who was once a commercial photographer, and has never received a college degree.</blockquote>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote>Hong Kong architect Gary Chang has renovated his tiny apartment four times since he&#8217;s owned it. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/15/garden/15hongkong.html?pagewanted=all">The most recent renovation is called &#8220;The Domestic Transformer&#8221;</a>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Mr. Chang hopes that some of his homeâ€™s innovations might be replicated to help improve domestic life in Hong Kong, which has been troubled in recent years. The population grew by nearly a half-million in just the last 10 years, and between 2003 and 2007, reports of new cases of child, spousal and elder abuse nearly doubled, something social workers attribute in part to new social pressures caused by the cityâ€™s ongoing shortage of space.

â€œItâ€™s a big problem,â€ Mr. Chang said. â€œKilling each other is not uncommon.â€

â€œPeople feel trapped,â€ he said. â€œWe have to find ways to live together in very small spaces.â€

In Mr. Changâ€™s solution, a kind of human-size briefcase, everything can be folded away so that the space feels expansive, like a yoga studio.

The wall units, which are suspended from steel tracks bolted into the ceiling, seem to float an inch above the reflective black granite floor. As they are shifted around, the apartment becomes all manner of spaces â€” kitchen, library, laundry room, dressing room, a lounge with a hammock, an enclosed dining area and a wet bar.</blockquote>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote>The overall set-up of IKEA minimises tax and disclosure, handsomely rewards the founding Kamprad family and makes IKEA immune to a takeover. And if that seems too good to be true, it is: these arrangements are extremely hard to undo. The benefits from all this ingenuity come at the price of a huge constraint on the successors to Ingvar Kamprad, the store&#8217;s founder, to do with IKEA as they see fit.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The parent for all IKEA companiesâ€”the operator of 207 of the 235 worldwide IKEA storesâ€”is Ingka Holding, a private Dutch-registered company. Ingka Holding, in turn, belongs entirely to Stichting Ingka Foundation. This is a Dutch-registered, tax-exempt, non-profit-making legal entity, which was given the shares of Mr Kamprad in 1982. Stichtingen, or foundations, are the most common form of not-for-profit organisation in the Netherlands; tens of thousands of them are registered.

Most Dutch stichtingen are tiny, but if Stichting Ingka Foundation were listed it would be one of the Netherlands&#8217; ten largest companies by market value.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Best Recipe Error
A report from Reuters:

    Celebrity chef Antony Worrall Thompson has apologized after accidentally recommending a potentially deadly plant in organic salads.
    The chef and TV presenter said in a magazine article that the weed henbane, also known as stinking nightshade, made an excellent addition to summertime mealsâ€¦
    Henbane, or Hyoscyamus niger, is toxic and can cause hallucinations, convulsions, vomiting and in extreme cases death.
    Worrall Thompson, who was discussing his passion for organic foods, had confused the plant with another of a similar name.
    The magazine â€œHealthy & Organic Livingâ€ printed an urgent warning: â€œHenbane is a very toxic plant and should never be eaten. As always, check with an expert when foraging or collecting wild plants.â€
    Henbane, a close relative of deadly nightshade, was used by Dr Crippen to kill his wife in 1910, and is thought to have been the main ingredient in the poison Romeo took in Shakespeareâ€™s play Romeo and Juliet.â€
    The chef had intended to refer to fat hen, a weed rich in vitamin C, that is edible, media reports saidâ€¦
    Worrall Thompson was reported in the media as saying the confusion had been â€œa bit embarrassing.â€</blockquote>
