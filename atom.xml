<blockquote>If youâ€™ve ever had a good, long look at the human phallus, whether yours or someone elseâ€™s, youâ€™ve probably scratched your head over such a peculiarly shaped device. Letâ€™s face itâ€”itâ€™s not the most intuitively shaped appendage in all of evolution. But according to evolutionary psychologist Gordon Gallup of the State University of New York at Albany, the human penis is actually an impressive â€œtoolâ€ in the truest sense of the word, one manufactured by nature over hundreds of thousands of years of human evolution. You may be surprised to discover just how highly specialized a tool it is. Furthermore, youâ€™d be amazed at what its appearance can tell us about the nature of our sexuality.</blockquote>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>Below you can hear Weegee talk about picture-making. It&#8217;s interesting to hear his voice, which is one of those accents you don&#8217;t hear so much in New York anymore: part Austro-Hungarian immigrant by way of the Lower East Side and part Elmer Fudd. Peter Sellers based his accent in Dr. Strangelove on Weegee&#8217;s voice after Weegee visited Kubrick&#8217;s set one day.</p></blockquote>

&#8220;Little Boy&#8221; (Hiroshima Atomic Bomb) 1945

Nice set of black and white (and infrared?) photos of cold war era Weapons of Mass Destruction.

<blockquote>The single, blinding release of pure energy over Hiroshima, Japan, on August 6, 1945, marked a startling and permanent break with our prior understandings of the visible world. Yet for more than sixty years the technology behind the explosion has remained a state secret.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The most accurate account of the bombâ€™s inner workingsâ€”an unnervingly detailed reconstruction, based on old photographs and documentsâ€”has been written by a sixty-one-year-old truck driver from Waukesha, Wisconsin, named John Coster-Mullen, who was once a commercial photographer, and has never received a college degree.</blockquote>
