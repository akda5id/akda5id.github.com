    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote>Hong Kong architect Gary Chang has renovated his tiny apartment four times since he's owned it. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/15/garden/15hongkong.html?pagewanted=all">The most recent renovation is called "The Domestic Transformer"</a>.</blockquote>




<blockquote>Mr. Chang hopes that some of his homeâ€™s innovations might be replicated to help improve domestic life in Hong Kong, which has been troubled in recent years. The population grew by nearly a half-million in just the last 10 years, and between 2003 and 2007, reports of new cases of child, spousal and elder abuse nearly doubled, something social workers attribute in part to new social pressures caused by the cityâ€™s ongoing shortage of space.

â€œItâ€™s a big problem,â€ Mr. Chang said. â€œKilling each other is not uncommon.â€

â€œPeople feel trapped,â€ he said. â€œWe have to find ways to live together in very small spaces.â€

In Mr. Changâ€™s solution, a kind of human-size briefcase, everything can be folded away so that the space feels expansive, like a yoga studio.

The wall units, which are suspended from steel tracks bolted into the ceiling, seem to float an inch above the reflective black granite floor. As they are shifted around, the apartment becomes all manner of spaces â€” kitchen, library, laundry room, dressing room, a lounge with a hammock, an enclosed dining area and a wet bar.</blockquote>

<p>Posted at <a href="http://www.squareamerica.com/">Square America</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Square America is a site dedicated to preserving and displaying vintage snapshots from the first 3/4s of the 20th Century. Not only do these photographs contain a wealth of primary source information on how life was lived they also constitute a shadow history of photography, one too often ignored by museums and art galleries. Or at least that's what I tell people- more accurately, the site is a catalog of my obsession with vintage photographs.</blockquote>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote>The evidence suggests that homosexual behaviour is partly genetic. Studies of identical twins, for example, show that if one of a pair (regardless of sex) is homosexual, the other has a 50% chance of being so, too. That observation, though, raises a worrying evolutionary question: how could a trait so at odds with reproductive success survive the ruthless imperatives of natural selection?Various answers have been suggested. However, they all boil down to the idea that the relatives of those who are gay gain some advantage that allows genes predisposing people to homosexual behaviour to be passed on collaterally.
    
One proposal is that the help provided by maiden aunts and bachelor uncles in caring and providing for the children of their brothers and sisters might suffice. That seems unlikely to be the whole story (the amount of help needed to compensate would be huge), though it might be a contributory factor.

The other idea, since there is evidence that male homosexuals, at least, are more likely than average to come from large families, is that the genes for gayness bring reproductive advantage to those who have them but are not actually gay themselves. Originally, the thought was that whichever genes make men gay might make women more fecund, and possibly vice versa.

Brendan Zietsch of the Queensland Institute of Medical Research in Brisbane, Australia, and his colleagues have, however, come up with a twist on this idea. In a paper to be published soon in Evolution and Human Behavior, they suggest the advantage accrues not to relatives of the opposite sex, but to those of the same one. They think that genes which cause men to be more feminine in appearance, outlook and behaviour and those that make women more masculine in those attributes, confer reproductive advantages as long as they do not push the individual possessing them all the way to homosexuality.</blockquote>
