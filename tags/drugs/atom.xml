    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Linda Marsa in <a href="http://discovermagazine.com/2008/jun/16-could-an-acid-trip-cure-your-ocd/">Discover Magazine</a>:</p>

<blockquote>At a handful of sites across the country, after a four-decade hiatus, psychedelic research is undergoing a quiet renaissance, thanks to scientists like Charles Grob who are revisiting the powerful mind-altering drugs of the 1960s in hopes of making them part of our therapeutic arsenal. Hallucinogens such as psilocybin, MDMA (better known as Ecstasy), and the most controversial of them all, LSD, are being tested as treatments for maladies that modern medicine has done little to assuage, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, drug dependency, obsessive-compulsive disorder, cluster headaches, and the emotional suffering of people with a terminal illness.

While Grobâ€™s study is not completeâ€”he has tested 11 out of a projected 12 volunteersâ€”patients seemed to have positive experiences. â€œNo one had a bad trip, and most derived some benefit,â€ he says. â€œIt lowered their anxiety, improved their mood and disposition, and imbued them with a greater acceptance of their situation and capacity to live in the moment and appreciate each day.â€</blockquote>


<p>This is a fairly well written article that covers the basics of past psychedelics research, and the current minimal studies that are going on now. I have archived the article <a href="http://s3.ubernerd.org/blog/2008/05/Could_an_Acid_Trip_Cure_Your_OCD.html">here</a> because Discover's site is completely broken in Safari, and hideously unusable in Firefox.</p>

<p>Thomas H. Maugh II | <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-hofmann30apr30,1,1408816,full.story">Los Angeles Times Staff Writer</a>:</p>

<blockquote>But Hofmann's life had already been altered. LSD and the other psychoactive drugs "changed my life, insofar as they provided me with a new concept about what reality is," he said. "Before, I had believed there was only one reality: the reality of everyday life.

"Under LSD, however, I entered into realities which were as real and even more real than the one of everyday." He also "became aware of the wonder of creation, the magnificence of nature and of the plant and animal kingdom. I became very sensitive to what will happen to all this and all of us."
