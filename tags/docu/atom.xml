    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>Below you can hear Weegee talk about picture-making. It's interesting to hear his voice, which is one of those accents you don't hear so much in New York anymore: part Austro-Hungarian immigrant by way of the Lower East Side and part Elmer Fudd. Peter Sellers based his accent in Dr. Strangelove on Weegee's voice after Weegee visited Kubrick's set one day.</p></blockquote>

During the last week of the Bush administration, I asked the head photo editors of these news services &#8212; Vincent Amalvy (AFP), Santiago Lyon (AP) and Jim Bourg (Reuters) &#8212; to pick the photographs of the president that they believe captured the character of the man and of his administration.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Posted by Doug Schulkind to <a href="http://blog.wfmu.org/freeform/2008/06/the-world-in-hi.html">WFMU's Beware of the Blog</a>.</p>

<blockquote>Recorded sound had no greater friend than Tony Schwartz, the audio documentarian, advertising guru, media consultant, and exalted citizen of the aural universe, who passed away Saturday a few months shy of his 85th birthday. He'll be forever linked to his best-known workâ€”the infamous "Daisy" ad from Lyndon Johnson's 1964 re-election campaignâ€”but to many, Schwartz is beloved for sharing with the world his lifelong infatuation with the musicality of prosaic sounds.</blockquote>


<p> And Doug posted some great clips from his albums, go listen.</p>
