<blockquote>
During the last week of the Bush administration, I asked the head photo editors of these news services &#8212; Vincent Amalvy (AFP), Santiago Lyon (AP) and Jim Bourg (Reuters) &#8212; to pick the photographs of the president that they believe captured the character of the man and of his administration.

<blockquote>Best Recipe Error
A report from Reuters:

    Celebrity chef Antony Worrall Thompson has apologized after accidentally recommending a potentially deadly plant in organic salads.
    The chef and TV presenter said in a magazine article that the weed henbane, also known as stinking nightshade, made an excellent addition to summertime mealsâ€¦
    Henbane, or Hyoscyamus niger, is toxic and can cause hallucinations, convulsions, vomiting and in extreme cases death.
    Worrall Thompson, who was discussing his passion for organic foods, had confused the plant with another of a similar name.
    The magazine â€œHealthy & Organic Livingâ€ printed an urgent warning: â€œHenbane is a very toxic plant and should never be eaten. As always, check with an expert when foraging or collecting wild plants.â€
    Henbane, a close relative of deadly nightshade, was used by Dr Crippen to kill his wife in 1910, and is thought to have been the main ingredient in the poison Romeo took in Shakespeareâ€™s play Romeo and Juliet.â€
    The chef had intended to refer to fat hen, a weed rich in vitamin C, that is edible, media reports saidâ€¦
    Worrall Thompson was reported in the media as saying the confusion had been â€œa bit embarrassing.â€</blockquote>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Lewis Page in <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/06/20/mackay_on_carbon_free_uk/print.html">The Register</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Professor David J C MacKay of the Cambridge University Department of Physics holds a PhD in computation from Cal Tech and a starred first in Physics, so we can take it that he knows his numbers. And, as he points out, numbers are typically lacking in current discussion around carbon emissions and energy use.

MacKay tells The Reg that he was first drawn into this field by the constant suggestion â€” from the Beeb, parts of the government etc â€” that we can seriously impact our personal energy consumption by doing such things as turning our TVs off standby or unplugging our mobile-phone chargers.

Anyone with even a slight grasp of energy units should know that this is madness. Skipping one bath saves a much energy as leaving your TV off standby for over six months. People who wash regularly, wear clean clothes, consume hot food or drink, use powered transport of any kind and live in warm houses have no need to worry about the energy they use to power their electronics; itâ€™s insignificant compared to the other things.</blockquote>


<p>The article goes on to summarize some of the solution scenarios MacKay worked out for the UK, and as you would expect nuclear is the only one that is close to achievable.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Posted to <a href="http://bramcohen.livejournal.com/47331.html">bramcohen</a>.</p>

<blockquote>The coverage of the current US primaries is mindbogglingly wrongheaded. Recent coverage has focused on who would 'win' New Hampshire among the democrats, and Huckabee's 'lead' among republicans. The actual numbers can be found <a href="http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/">here</a>. New Hampshire is <b>not</b> a winner-take-all state for democrats, and both Clinton and Obama got exactly nine delegates from there, making the declaration of a 'winner' extremely misleading, if not outright revealing of the declarer having dubious mental capacity. Among republicans, Mitt Romney now has the most delegates, with Huckabee in second, and the media is currently speculating that Romney will drop out because he's so far 'behind'.<br /><br />Seriously, what is wrong with journalists? Are they not able to do basic arithmetic? Ideally I'd like to have meta-coverage discussing why some states are winner take all and others aren't, and what on earth 'super-delegates' are, but I'd settle for even an accurate portrayal of what's happening in the race as it unfolds.<br /><br />But thank you CNN for putting up a nice site which gives accurate up-to-date information. Please expand it in the future with more explanation of what 'super delegates' are, and what happens to a candidate's delegates if they drop out of the race.</blockquote>
