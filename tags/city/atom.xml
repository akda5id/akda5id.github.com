    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote>Hong Kong architect Gary Chang has renovated his tiny apartment four times since he's owned it. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/15/garden/15hongkong.html?pagewanted=all">The most recent renovation is called "The Domestic Transformer"</a>.</blockquote>




<blockquote>Mr. Chang hopes that some of his homeâ€™s innovations might be replicated to help improve domestic life in Hong Kong, which has been troubled in recent years. The population grew by nearly a half-million in just the last 10 years, and between 2003 and 2007, reports of new cases of child, spousal and elder abuse nearly doubled, something social workers attribute in part to new social pressures caused by the cityâ€™s ongoing shortage of space.

â€œItâ€™s a big problem,â€ Mr. Chang said. â€œKilling each other is not uncommon.â€

â€œPeople feel trapped,â€ he said. â€œWe have to find ways to live together in very small spaces.â€

In Mr. Changâ€™s solution, a kind of human-size briefcase, everything can be folded away so that the space feels expansive, like a yoga studio.

The wall units, which are suspended from steel tracks bolted into the ceiling, seem to float an inch above the reflective black granite floor. As they are shifted around, the apartment becomes all manner of spaces â€” kitchen, library, laundry room, dressing room, a lounge with a hammock, an enclosed dining area and a wet bar.</blockquote>

Robert C. Wiles, 1947</span></p>

<blockquote>On May Day, just after leaving her fiancÃ©, 23-year-old Evelyn McHale wrote a note. 'He is much better off without me ... I wouldn't make a good wife for anybody,' ... Then she crossed it out. She went to the observation platform of the Empire State Building. Through the mist she gazed at the street, 86 floors below. Then she jumped. In her desperate determination she leaped clear of the setbacks and hit a United Nations limousine parked at the curb. Across the street photography student Robert Wiles heard an explosive crash. Just four minutes after Evelyn McHale's death Wiles got this picture of death's violence and its composure.</blockquote>
