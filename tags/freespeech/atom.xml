    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><a href="http://youtomb.mit.edu">YouTomb</a> is a research project by MIT Free Culture that tracks videos taken down from YouTube for alleged copyright violation.

More specifically, YouTomb continually monitors the most popular videos on YouTube for copyright-related takedowns. Any information available in the metadata is retained, including who issued the complaint and how long the video was up before takedown. The goal of the project is to identify how YouTube recognizes potential copyright violations as well as to aggregate mistakes made by the algorithm.</blockquote>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Posted by iang to <a href="https://financialcryptography.com/mt/archives/001011.html">Financial Cryptography</a>.</p>

<blockquote>Interesting news: According to the posts over at <a href="http://idcorner.org/2008/03/06/microsoft-acquires-credenticas-u-prove-technology/">identity corner</a>, <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/privacyimperative/">Microsoft is picking up (some of? all of?) Credentica's patent portfolio</a>, and Stefan Brands himself will join the team.</blockquote>


<p>Brands has one (of two) lineages of patents on digital blinding, the other one was via David Chaum, and is now lost somewhere in some bank's hands due to bankruptcy. Though Chaum was working on something new, haven't heard anything about that . . . Anyhow, this means Microsoft is in control of the current state of the art for digital money, and identity management.</p>

<p><a href="http://idcorner.org/2008/03/06/microsoft-acquires-credenticas-u-prove-technology/#comments">Comment by Stephan Engberg</a>: <blockquote>Congratulations - it must have been a fantastic monetary offer to make you withdraw credentials from the open market like this and hand over control of identity to MS.</p>

<p>This just set [Privacy Enhancing Technologies] back many years.</blockquote></p>

<p>And Kim Cameron (Microsoft) has a great round up of the PR and reactions in the wake of the announcement at identityblog:  <a href="http://www.identityblog.com/?p=937">Reactions to Credentica acquisition</a></p>

<p>He ends with:</p>

<blockquote>That doesnâ€™t mean it is trivial to figure out the best legal mecahnisms for making the intellectual property and even the code available to the ecosystem.  Lawyers are needed, and it takes a while.  But I can guarantee everyone that I have zero intention of hoarding Minimal Disclosure Tokens or turning U-Prove into a proprietary Microsoft technology silo.

<p> Sure you don't, but what about your evil overlords?</p>

â€œThis campaign is an extraordinary rendition of a public-private partnership,â€ observed BLF spokesperson Blank DeCoverly. â€œThese two titans of telecom have a long and intimate relationship, dating back to the age of the telegraph. In these dark days of Terrorism, that should be a comfort to every law-abiding citizen with nothing to hide.â€</blockquote>

<blockquote>Ever since v-2.org went down for the count, I get a fair number of requests to repost this minifesto on â€œopen-source constitutions for post-national entitites,â€ from 2003. Itâ€™s goofy, itâ€™s naÃ¯ve, itâ€™s grandiose and pompousâ€¦and I present it to you now exactly as I wrote it then. Enjoy!</blockquote>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've been following this <a href="http://journalism.nyu.edu/pubzone/weblogs/pressthink/2006/07/25/nadn_qa.html">NewAssignment.Net</a> thing, but Jay writes too damn much to point to any one piece he does on it for someone else to read (not that I read it all). This interview with /. goes all over the place, its not just about NA.net, and talks about some pretty interesting things in reporting (and is fairly readable because he is talking down to /., not to his academia buddies).</p>

<blockquote>Create more writers and suddenly you may need more editors. â€œThe conversation feeds journalism, journalism feeds the conversationâ€ is a powerful idea, but we are several steps away from knowing how it works to create a live, intelligent filter in the newsroom.</blockquote>




<blockquote>The normal tensions with the press were driven deeper: keep them back, keep them out, tell them nothing, tear them down. If someone does break a story from inside you immediately punish and isolate anyone who spoke to the reporter. You make them disown their words. You make them repent.

This is the story Woodward missed because he got inside it, so to speak. Ron Suskind, one of the few in Washington who did not miss that story, called it "the retreat from empiricism." To me, it's the big narrative yet to come out about the Bush White House. <i>Attack Without a Plan</i> was too crazy to be credible to Woodward. So he wrote <i>Plan of Attack</i> instead.</blockquote>
