<blockquote>Best Recipe Error
A report from Reuters:

    Celebrity chef Antony Worrall Thompson has apologized after accidentally recommending a potentially deadly plant in organic salads.
    The chef and TV presenter said in a magazine article that the weed henbane, also known as stinking nightshade, made an excellent addition to summertime mealsâ€¦
    Henbane, or Hyoscyamus niger, is toxic and can cause hallucinations, convulsions, vomiting and in extreme cases death.
    Worrall Thompson, who was discussing his passion for organic foods, had confused the plant with another of a similar name.
    The magazine â€œHealthy & Organic Livingâ€ printed an urgent warning: â€œHenbane is a very toxic plant and should never be eaten. As always, check with an expert when foraging or collecting wild plants.â€
    Henbane, a close relative of deadly nightshade, was used by Dr Crippen to kill his wife in 1910, and is thought to have been the main ingredient in the poison Romeo took in Shakespeareâ€™s play Romeo and Juliet.â€
    The chef had intended to refer to fat hen, a weed rich in vitamin C, that is edible, media reports saidâ€¦
    Worrall Thompson was reported in the media as saying the confusion had been â€œa bit embarrassing.â€</blockquote>

<blockquote>â€œI remember when I was a kid,â€ Pelletier explains in the text within the brochure, â€œthere was a rumour â€“ I donâ€™t know if it was true - that at McDonalds, the benches were made so that you wouldnâ€™t spend too much time there.â€ It was from that thought the idea for the Slightly Uncomfortable Chair Collection (SUCC) came.</blockquote>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote>The Near Future Laboratory Top-15 Criteria for New or Interactive Media Art are...

15. It doesn't work

14. It doesn't work because you couldn't get a hold of a 220-to-110 volt converter/110-to-220 volt converter/PAL-to-NTSC/NTSC-to-PAL scan converter/serial-to-usb adapter/"dongle" of any sort..and the town you're in is simply not the kind of place that has/cares about such things

13. Your audience looks under/behind your table/pedestal/false wall/drop ceiling or follows wires to find out "where the camera is"

12. Someone either on their blog or across the room is prattling on about the shifting relations between producers and consumers..and mentions your project

11. Your audience "interacts" by clapping/hooting/making bird calls/flapping their arms like a duck or waving their arms wildly while standing in front of a wall onto which is projected squiggly lines

10. Your audience asks amongst themselves, "how does it work?"

9. The exhibition curators insist that you spend hours standing by your own wall text so that you can explain to attendees "how it works"

8. It's just like using your own normal, human, perfectly good eyeballs, only the resolution sucks and the colors are really lousy..plus the heat from the CPU fan is blowing on your forehead which makes you really uncomfortable and schvitz-y

7. Someone in your audience wearing a Crumpler bag, slinging a fancy digital SLR and/or standing with their arms folded smugly says, "Yeah..yeah, I could've done that too..c'mon dude..some Perlin Noise? And Processing/Ruby-on-Rails/AJAX/Blue LEDs/MaxMSP/An Infrared Camera/Lots of Free Time/etc.? Pfft..It's so easy..."

6. Someone in your audience, maybe the same guy with the Crumpler bag and digital SLR excitedly says, "Oh, dude. That should totally be a Facebook app!"

5. It's called a "project" and not a "piece of art"

4. You saw the "project" years ago...and here it is again...now with multi-touch interaction and other fancy digital bells and Web 2.0-y whistles

3. Your audience cups their hands over various proturbances/orifices at or nearby your project attempting to confuse/interact with the camera/sensor/laser beam, even if it uses no such technology

2. There's a noticeable preponderance of smoothly shifting red, green and blue lighting effects

1. People wonder if it wasn't all really done in Photoshop, anyway</blockquote>
