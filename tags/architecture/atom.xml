    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote>Hong Kong architect Gary Chang has renovated his tiny apartment four times since he's owned it. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/15/garden/15hongkong.html?pagewanted=all">The most recent renovation is called "The Domestic Transformer"</a>.</blockquote>




<blockquote>Mr. Chang hopes that some of his homeâ€™s innovations might be replicated to help improve domestic life in Hong Kong, which has been troubled in recent years. The population grew by nearly a half-million in just the last 10 years, and between 2003 and 2007, reports of new cases of child, spousal and elder abuse nearly doubled, something social workers attribute in part to new social pressures caused by the cityâ€™s ongoing shortage of space.

â€œItâ€™s a big problem,â€ Mr. Chang said. â€œKilling each other is not uncommon.â€

â€œPeople feel trapped,â€ he said. â€œWe have to find ways to live together in very small spaces.â€

In Mr. Changâ€™s solution, a kind of human-size briefcase, everything can be folded away so that the space feels expansive, like a yoga studio.

The wall units, which are suspended from steel tracks bolted into the ceiling, seem to float an inch above the reflective black granite floor. As they are shifted around, the apartment becomes all manner of spaces â€” kitchen, library, laundry room, dressing room, a lounge with a hammock, an enclosed dining area and a wet bar.</blockquote>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote>ETFE is temperature-resistant, lightweight (1/100th the weight of glass), recyclable, non-toxic when exposed to flame (it actually shrinks away from heat, thus helping to vent smoke out of a burning building), highly insulative, non-porous, and non-stick. Even better, its high-tensile strength makes it easy to manipulateâ€”it can be spun into thin sheets for ease of transport then inflated on-site to create the "pillow" effect of the Aquatics Center walls. It can also be finished in varying degrees of translucenceâ€”as transparent as glass or opaque as glass bricks.</blockquote>
