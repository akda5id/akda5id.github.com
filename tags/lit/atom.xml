<blockquote>At the station before Queensway, Lancaster Gate, he had broken from protocol to announce to the pranksters holding up the doors not the scripted "Mind the closing doors" but the more personal "please stop doing that or you will injure yourselves and end up in hospital." The statement had a slight, "I-know-better" air, but it was also improvised, and showed concern for passengers' well-being. I remembered this minor act of kindness as our driver addressed us on the intercom to announce the evacuation. He kept repeating: "This train is not going anywhere for some time. We have a man under the train, so the train is not going anywhere for some time." It became a sort of mantra: "I repeat: this train is not going anywhere for some time."</blockquote>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote>ORAL HISTORY INTERVIEW WITH SAMUEL BRONKOWSKI AT HIS HOME IN TUCSON RESERVATION, BY GALEN PARR 5.1, DATED JUNE 17, 2078

SB: This one's called, "Bruce Schneier and the King of the Crabs." It mostly must have really happened, too â€“ it's how we lost Barbados, or Bermuda, or some island down there anyway.

GP: I don't believe we have that one on file. But it would probably be Barbados, because that's still a restricted zone. I don't know why. I thought it was nuclear, though.

SB: Well, may well be I can shed some light on that. I personally don't think this actually happened to Bruce Schneier, but that's the way it was told to me, and it's still worth telling. Story goes, ol' Bruce Schneier was vacationing on Barbados with his dog once. And they'd go out walking on the beach, as men and dogs often do.</blockquote>

<blockquote>American writer Susan Sontag was terrified of death. She beat cancer in the 1970s, and again in the 1990s, but third time around she wasn't so lucky. In a tender account of her final illness, her son David Rieff recalls how he colluded with his mother's fantasy that she wasn't dying - and what this ultimately cost him after she had gone.</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Basically, it&rsquo;s the story of Thomas&rsquo;s doomed attempt to interview Ballard. He takes a taxi to Shepperton, and before he knows it is in a parallel dimension, being driven by a gruff hoodlum with clear contempt for his passenger.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Bob Rodgers essay in <a href="http://lrc.reviewcanada.ca/index.php?page=In-the-Garden-with-the-Guru">Literary Review of Canada</a>:</p>

<blockquote>A six-foot-high hedge separated me from the garden next door but not from its voices. It was my first Sunday morning in the house I sublet on Wells Hill Avenue by Casa Loma in Toronto. I couldnâ€™t make out what was being said but one of the voices sounded familiar. I moved closer and parted the hedge just enough for a covert glimpse of my new neighbours. A middle-aged man was lying on his back in a hammock with a book held up vertically above his head as he read aloud. Next to him a young man sat in a deck chair with a book on his lap. The young man said: â€œVicoâ€™s cycles.â€ The older man said: â€œVicious Circles.â€ â€œViscous cyclones,â€œ said the young man. I was awestruck. My God, I thought, I must be the only person in the world at this moment listening to what looks like a tag team reading Finnegans Wake. Later I learned I had been witness to a regular occurrence. Eric McLuhan and his father, Marshall, were reading at each other.</blockquote>
