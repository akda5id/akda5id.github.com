<blockquote>The coverage of the current US primaries is mindbogglingly wrongheaded. Recent coverage has focused on who would &#8216;win&#8217; New Hampshire among the democrats, and Huckabee&#8217;s &#8216;lead&#8217; among republicans. The actual numbers can be found <a href="http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/">here</a>. New Hampshire is <b>not</b> a winner-take-all state for democrats, and both Clinton and Obama got exactly nine delegates from there, making the declaration of a &#8216;winner&#8217; extremely misleading, if not outright revealing of the declarer having dubious mental capacity. Among republicans, Mitt Romney now has the most delegates, with Huckabee in second, and the media is currently speculating that Romney will drop out because he&#8217;s so far &#8216;behind&#8217;.<br /><br />Seriously, what is wrong with journalists? Are they not able to do basic arithmetic? Ideally I&#8217;d like to have meta-coverage discussing why some states are winner take all and others aren&#8217;t, and what on earth &#8216;super-delegates&#8217; are, but I&#8217;d settle for even an accurate portrayal of what&#8217;s happening in the race as it unfolds.<br /><br />But thank you CNN for putting up a nice site which gives accurate up-to-date information. Please expand it in the future with more explanation of what &#8216;super delegates&#8217; are, and what happens to a candidate&#8217;s delegates if they drop out of the race.</blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote>Observers of Tokyo have for long admired its fluidity, its capacity to constantly reinvent itself and its ability of multiplying, juxtaposing, and overlaying functions. The history of Tokyoâ€™s urban development in the past century is mainly one of incremental and spontaneous development of the parts assembling to form a whole. Modernizers have for long attempted to â€œrationalizeâ€ Tokyo, but were ultimately unable to cope with the extremely rapid demographic and urban expansion.

What made this process quite distinctive (from other Asian urban histories) is that official policies did not dismiss the cityâ€™s organic evolution. The mixed-use habitats, the village like social foundations of the urban neighbourhoods and the low-rise high density landscape emerged as a default urban model. A model that was not seen as an ideal one by planners, but which also was not considered illegitimate.</blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content">Jennifer Senior in <a href="http://nymag.com/news/features/42595/">New York Magazine</a>
<blockquote>In 2000, there were 7,000 American households worth $100 million or more; in 2003, there were 10,000; and today, though the data isnâ€™t yet in, Boston College estimates that the number will be 14,000 or 15,000, or double what it was at the beginning of the millennium. If you pare back the standard from eight zeroes to seven, the numbers are even more surprising: Boston College has calculated that in 2004, the last time the Fed provided data, there were 649,000 American households worth $10 million or more, a nearly 300 percent jump since 1992. [&#8230;]

At some point, the offspring of this charmed class will be the stewards of the dollhouse nation their parents have createdâ€”and, more important, the caretakers of its treasury. Already, Boston College projects that inheritances received between 2003 and 2007 will be 50 percent larger than those received between 1998 and 2002, and thatâ€™s after adjusting for inflation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In a recent study, professor of psychiatry Harrison Pope, co-director of the Biological Psychiatry Lab at Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital, put â€œrepressed memoryâ€ to the test of time. He reasoned that if dissociative amnesia were an innate capability of the brainâ€”akin to depression, hallucinations, anxiety, and dementiaâ€”it would appear in written works throughout history. In collaboration with associate professor of psychiatry James Hudson, Michael Parker, a professor of English at the U.S. Naval Academy, Michael Poliakoff, director of education programs at the National Endowment for the Humanities, and research assistant Matthew Boynes, Pope set out to find the earliest recorded example of a â€œrepressed memory.â€</blockquote>

<blockquote>Friedrich&#8217;s article, when taken with images of the wildfires in California, and those around Australian cities in recent years, gave me pause to consider how urban form and fire are related. I don&#8217;t want to use the terrible fires around California, and in Australia before them, as my own spurious token in an academic argument about urban planning. And yet I can&#8217;t help but correlate urban sprawl with placing more and more people into areas consistently threatened by fire. In this, the contemporary form of the sprawling city is not only something that is bad for the city in general - you could argue that point of course, but I don&#8217;t think it can really be doubted&nbsp; - but also just supremely dangerous.</blockquote>

The conclusion:
<blockquote>Nobu, the young salaryman, likes his job but plans to start his own business one day. The older men in his office struck compromises that he is not prepared to endure. â€œAfter 1945, we were left with nothing, so we had to work together, with the same goal and as one team. We were a success, and Japan grew,â€ he says. â€œBut this organisation doesn&#8217;t work any more. It has stayed the same for too long. The system has rusted.â€</blockquote>
