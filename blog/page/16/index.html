<blockquote>This effect was amplified by the play of light and sound. By turning on and off the various floodlights outside, you could adjust the mood of the entire house. When the lights are dimmed, for example, the house becomes less theatrical, more tender. Voices too travel through the rooms, so that you are always faintly aware of the presence of the other.

It wasnâ€™t until we arose the next morning, however, that we fully understood Chareauâ€™s choreography. The bathroom floor is raised in certain areas so that as we crossed it, we could catch occasional glimpses of each other before suddenly dropping back out of view.</blockquote>

Tobias battenberg, from Germany, made a nice experiment with video projections in several buildings and structures in the city, about the font &#8220;akzidenz grotesk&#8221;.
<i>Akzidenz grotesk is known as a font that tolerates a lot, that holds out a lot - my plan was to get a proof by the font herself. the font demonstrated her character at its best.</i>

  <div class="entry-content">Via Kenny G at <a href="http://blog.wfmu.org/freeform/2007/07/sly-stone-found.html">WFMU&#8217;s Beware of the Blog</a>.

Vanity Fair article by by David Kamp on Sly Stone&#8217;s reappearance.

<blockquote>&#8220;There&#8217;s one that&#8217;s called &#8216;We&#8217;re Sick Like That,&#8217;&#8221; he continues. &#8220;It says, &#8216;Give a boy a flag and teach him to salute / Give the same boy a gun and teach him how to shoot / And then one night, the boy in the bushes, he starts to cry / &#8216;Cause nobody ever really taught him how to die.&#8217;&#8221;

The obvious allusion to the current war jars me, and I soon realize why: Stone has been absent from the scene for such a duration that it&#8217;s hard to imagine that he was with us all along, experiencing all the things we experienced over the yearsâ€”the fall of the Berlin Wall, the collapse of the Soviet Union, Nelson Mandela&#8217;s release from prison, the rise of the World Wide Web, the attacks on 9/11, the invasion of Iraq. It&#8217;s almost as if he went into a decades-long deep freeze, like Austin Powers or the astronauts in Planet of the Apes. Except he didn&#8217;t.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Electric contacts are mounted on the support block of the Machine, where the hand is situated. These contacts are activated as soon as the first &#8220;nervous sweat&#8221; appears that turns the skin into a conductor. Subsequently the computer becomes disturbed by the electric current that is now transmitted via the skin.

This has two effects: on the one hand, sounds are generated by the closure of the contacts (circuit bending) that can either be interpreted as warning or act as an additional source of stress. On the other hand, they can have an effect on the position of the knife which is controlled by the computer and thereby hurt the potential perpetrator of the disturbance.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Last October the Luxury Marketing Council, an international organisation of 675 luxury-goods firms, opened its India chapter. Its boss, Devyani Raman, described India&#8217;s luxury-goods market as â€œa cupboard full of beautiful clothes with a new outfit arriving every dayâ€”it could start to look messy without the right careâ€. This, she said, included everything from teaching shop assistants appropriate manners to instilling in the Indian public a proper understanding of the concept of luxury. â€œHow do you educate themâ€, she asked, â€œabout the difference between a designer bag that costs $400 and a much cheaper leather bag that functions perfectly well?â€</blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2007/08/assurance.html">Schneier</a> on the recent release of the California security review of electronic voting machines, and what CA is doing about the across the board failures:

<blockquote>California Secretary of State Debra Bowen has conditionally recertified the machines for use, as long as the makers fix the discovered vulnerabilities and adhere to a lengthy list of security requirements designed to limit future security breaches and failures. [ &#8230;] While this is a good effort, it has security completely backward. It begins with a presumption of security. [&#8230;] Insecurity is the norm. If any system &#8211; whether a voting machine, operating system, database, badge-entry system, RFID passport system, etc. &#8211; is ever built completely vulnerability-free, it&#8217;ll be the first time in the history of mankind. It&#8217;s not a good bet.
</blockquote>

So, what to do? Assurance:

<blockquote>Several years ago, former National Security Agency technical director Brian Snow began talking about the concept of &#8220;assurance&#8221; in security. Snow, who spent 35 years at the NSA building systems at security levels far higher than anything the commercial world deals with, told audiences that the agency couldn&#8217;t use modern commercial systems with their backward security thinking. Assurance was his antidote.</blockquote>
