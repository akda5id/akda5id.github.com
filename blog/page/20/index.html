Seems like this would be a good headfuck when you are tripping.

<blockquote>Overheard at the &#8220;INTELLIGENT PRINTING&#8221; conference, Oct 2006

&#8220;We&#8217;re in the business of putting goo on a substrate.&#8221;

&#8220;We need a taxonomy for &#8216;printing-that-is-no-longer-printing.&#8217;&#8221;

&#8220;Your mega-customer, the anchor tenant in the mall of your dreams&#8221;

&#8220;It&#8217;s the business of killing trees and putting chemicals on them.&#8221;

&#8220;Baseball cards that suck in energy and run e-ink animated displays&#8221;

&#8220;They&#8217;re not hiding, they&#8217;re just selective.&#8221;

&#8220;We help companies put together arguments and stories to win that venture money.&#8221;

&#8220;Those Austrian farm-boys didn&#8217;t know that ink-plants were supposed to be messy, so that was one of the cleanest plants they ever had.&#8221;

&#8220;Electronic cardboard blurs the line between printed objects and the virtual world.&#8221;

&#8220;The supply chain is a network of atoms.&#8221;

&#8220;Six trillion RFID tags is four orders of magnitude bigger than any electronic item ever made.&#8221;

&#8220;You can&#8217;t take on the Silicon Gorilla face to face.&#8221;

&#8220;Fluidic Self-Assembly Machines aren&#8217;t &#8216;printing&#8217; &#8211; they&#8217;re the competition.&#8221;

  <div class="entry-content">I am reading <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerando_%28novel%29">Accelerando</a></i> by Charles Stross. It is a deeply flawed look at the post singularity world, but I am prepared to forgive it it&#8217;s flaws due to the fact that to look beyond the beyond is impossible (the definition of singularity strongly relates to the inability to understand). Anyhow one of the most interesting parts of the book is the poking at what a truly efficient economy would be, and what happens when tech makes that posable.

Now the SEC is going to push the first step into giving AI&#8217;s the data to run the stock market :gonk::

Posted by Tim Bray to <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/">ongoing</a>.

<blockquote>I spent a couple of fascinating hours Tuesday at a round table hosted by the United States <a href="http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2006/2006-166.htm">Securities and Exchange Commission</a>.  The subject was <a href="http://www.sec.gov/spotlight/xbrl.htm">Interactive Data</a>, a term which is hardly self-explanatory but really means &#8220;Business Transparency&#8221;. This in the same week that Jonathan  <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/entry/one_small_step_for_the">sent a letter</a> on the same subject to SEC Chairman <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/10/04/SEC">Christopher Cox</a>, who was also around the table. Mr. Cox and the SEC are definitely on the right track; I expect bumps in the road, but there&#8217;s a chance that Accounting As We Know It could be blown up. Which would be a good thing; and not just because Open Source is creeping in.</blockquote>

(I am kidding about the :gonk: bit, this is pretty cool, and will help us humans &#8220;keep the thieves out&#8221; as Tim says. Just don&#8217;t let the computers take over man, man.)

  <div class="entry-content">I&#8217;ve been following this <a href="http://journalism.nyu.edu/pubzone/weblogs/pressthink/2006/07/25/nadn_qa.html">NewAssignment.Net</a> thing, but Jay writes too damn much to point to any one piece he does on it for someone else to read (not that I read it all). This interview with /. goes all over the place, its not just about NA.net, and talks about some pretty interesting things in reporting (and is fairly readable because he is talking down to /., not to his academia buddies).

<blockquote>Create more writers and suddenly you may need more editors. â€œThe conversation feeds journalism, journalism feeds the conversationâ€ is a powerful idea, but we are several steps away from knowing how it works to create a live, intelligent filter in the newsroom.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The normal tensions with the press were driven deeper: keep them back, keep them out, tell them nothing, tear them down. If someone does break a story from inside you immediately punish and isolate anyone who spoke to the reporter. You make them disown their words. You make them repent.

This is the story Woodward missed because he got inside it, so to speak. Ron Suskind, one of the few in Washington who did not miss that story, called it &#8220;the retreat from empiricism.&#8221; To me, it&#8217;s the big narrative yet to come out about the Bush White House. <i>Attack Without a Plan</i> was too crazy to be credible to Woodward. So he wrote <i>Plan of Attack</i> instead.</blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content">Crazy story:
<blockquote>It might have ended there, another high-flying company with big ambitions and a lousy product. But the crash put a spotlight on Eriksson and raised a series of questions: Who is he? What kind of person drives nearly 200 mph on a coastal highway? The answers led to even more puzzles. In just a few years, it seems, Eriksson went from languishing in a European jail cell to making millions as a tech executive to, even more improbably, becoming deputy commissioner of antiterrorism for an obscure Southern California transit police force.</blockquote>
