  <div class="entry-content">Robert Stickgold and Jeffrey M. Ellenbogen  in <a href="http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=how-snoozing-makes-you-smarter&amp;print=true">Scientific American Mind</a>
<blockquote>In 2007 one of us (Ellenbogen) showed that the brain learns while we are asleep. The study used a transitive inference task; for example, if Bill is older than Carol and Carol is older than Pierre, the laws of transitivity make it clear that Bill is older than Pierre. Making this inference requires stitching those two fragments of information together. People and animals tend to make these transitive inferences without much conscious thought, and the ability to do so serves as an enormously helpful cognitive skill: we discover new information (Bill is older than Pierre) without ever learning it directly.

The inference seems obvious in Bill and Pierreâ€™s case, but in the experiment, we used abstract colored shapes that have no intuitive relation to one another, making the task more challenging. We taught people so-called premise pairsâ€”they learned to choose, for example, the orange oval over the turquoise one, turquoise over green, green over paisley, and so on. The premise pairs imply a hierarchyâ€”if orange is a better choice than turquoise and turquoise is preferred to green, then orange should win over green. But when we tested the subjects on these novel pairings 20 minutes after they learned the premise pairs, they had not yet discovered these hidden relations. They chose green just as often as they chose orange, performing no better than chance.

When we tested subjects 12 hours later on the same day, however, they made the correct choice 70 percent of the time. Simply allowing time to pass enabled the brain to calculate and learn these transitive inferences. And people who slept during the 12 hours performed significantly better, linking the most distant pairs (such as orange versus paisley) with 90 percent accuracy. So it seems the brain needs time after we learn information to process it, connecting the dots, so to speakâ€”and sleep provides the maximum benefit.</blockquote>

I remembered this minor act of kindness as our driver addressed us on the intercom to announce the evacuation. He kept repeating: &#8220;This train is not going anywhere for some time. We have a man under the train, so the train is not going anywhere for some time.&#8221; It became a sort of mantra: &#8220;I repeat: this train is not going anywhere for some time.&#8221;</blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content">In the <a href="http://www.economist.com/finance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=11785391&amp;fsrc=RSS">Economist</a>:
<blockquote>In the late 1990s a generation of academic economists had their eyes opened by Mr LeDouxâ€™s and other accounts of how studies of the brain using recently developed techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed that different bits of the old grey matter are associated with different sorts of emotional and decision-making activity. The amygdalas are an example. Neuroscientists have shown that these almond-shaped clusters of neurons deep inside the medial temporal lobes play a key role in the formation of emotional responses such as fear.

These new neuroeconomists saw that it might be possible to move economics away from its simplified model of rational, self-interested, utility-maximising decision-making. Instead of hypothesising about Homo economicus, they could base their research on what actually goes on inside the head of Homo sapiens.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>However, not everyone is convinced. The fiercest attack on neuroeconomics, and indeed behavioural economics, has come from two economists at Princeton University, Faruk Gul and Wolfgang Pesendorfer. In an article in 2005, â€œThe Case for Mindless Economicsâ€, they argued that neuroscience could not transform economics because what goes on inside the brain is irrelevant to the discipline. What matters are the decisions people takeâ€”in the jargon, their â€œrevealed preferencesâ€â€”not the process by which they reach them. For the purposes of understanding how society copes with the consequences of those decisions, the assumption of rational utility-maximisation works just fine.</blockquote>

Sometime next year, Polaroid will stop producing instant film. There have been lots of people jumping in to help save the format, and others writing some striking eulogies, as the rest of us start mourning the oncoming loss. But one thing I canâ€™t quite shake is what Polaroid represents to me, something that will likely be on its way out the door too: the visual metaphor of a photograph.

  <div class="entry-content">Via the previous item on Polaroids, I found this:
<blockquote>
When Jamie Livingston, photographer, filmmaker, circus performer, accordian player, Mets fan, and above all, loyal friend, died on October 25th (his birthday) in 1997 at the age of 41, he left behind hundreds of bereft friends and a collection of 6,000 photographs neatly organized in small suitcases and wooden fruit crates.

	Jamie took a polaroid once a day, every day, including his last, for 18 years.

	This photographic diary, which he called, &#8220;Polaroid of the Day,&#8221; or P.O.D., began when Jaime was a student at Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson. The project continued when he moved to apartments in New York City including the incredible circus memorabilia-filled loft on Fulton Street, which he shared with his best friend. That loft was the site of many a Glug party, an &#8220;orphans thanksgiving,&#8221; a super-8 festival of Jamie&#8217;s lyrical Super-8 films, and a rollicking music jam.</blockquote>
