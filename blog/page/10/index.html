  <div class="entry-content">Po Bronson at <a href="http://www.printthis.clickability.com/pt/cpt?action=cpt&amp;title=Learning+to+Lie&amp;expire=&amp;urlID=26437742&amp;fb=Y&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fnymag.com%2Fnews%2Ffeatures%2F43893%2F&amp;partnerID=73272">New York Magazine</a>:

<blockquote>It starts very young. Indeed, bright kidsâ€”those who do better on other academic indicatorsâ€”are able to start lying at 2 or 3. â€œLying is related to intelligence,â€ explains Dr. Victoria Talwar, an assistant professor at Montrealâ€™s McGill University and a leading expert on childrenâ€™s lying behavior.

Although we think of truthfulness as a young childâ€™s paramount virtue, it turns out that lying is the more advanced skill. A child who is going to lie must recognize the truth, intellectually conceive of an alternate reality, and be able to convincingly sell that new reality to someone else. Therefore, lying demands both advanced cognitive development and social skills that honesty simply doesnâ€™t require. â€œItâ€™s a developmental milestone,â€ Talwar has concluded.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The most disturbing reason children lie is that parents teach them to. According to Talwar, they learn it from us. â€œWe donâ€™t explicitly tell them to lie, but they see us do it. They see us tell the telemarketer, â€˜Iâ€™m just a guest here.â€™ They see us boast and lie to smooth social relationships.â€

Consider how we expect a child to act when he opens a gift he doesnâ€™t like. We instruct him to swallow all his honest reactions and put on a polite smile. Talwar runs an experiment where children play games to win a present, but when they finally receive the present, itâ€™s a lousy bar of soap. After giving the kids a moment to overcome the shock, a researcher asks them how they like it. About a quarter of preschoolers can lie that they like the giftâ€”by elementary school, about half.</blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content">Bruce Sterling&#8217;s <a href="http://www.sfsite.com/fsf/fiction/bs01.htm">Kiosk</a>:
<blockquote>THE FABRIKATOR WAS UGLY, noisy, a fire hazard, and it smelled. Borislav got it for the kids in the neighborhood.

One snowy morning, in his work gloves, long coat, and fur hat, he loudly power-sawed through the wall of his kiosk. He duct-taped and stapled the fabrikator into place.    

The neighborhood kids caught on instantly. His new venture was a big hit.

The fabrikator made little plastic toys from 3-D computer models. After a week, the fab&#8217;s dirt-cheap toys literally turned into dirt. The fabbed toys just crumbled away, into a waxy, non-toxic substance that the smaller kids tended to chew.

Borislav had naturally figured that the brief lifetime of these toys might discourage the kids from buying them. This just wasn&#8217;t so. This wasn&#8217;t a bug: this was a feature. Every day after school, an eager gang of kids clustered around Borislav&#8217;s green kiosk. They slapped down their tinny pocket change with mittened hands. Then they exulted, quarreled, and sometimes even punched each other over the shining fab-cards.    

The happy kid would stick the fab-card (adorned with some glossily fraudulent pic of the toy) into the fabrikator&#8217;s slot. After a hot, deeply exciting moment of hissing, spraying, and stinking, the fab would burp up a freshly minted dinosaur, baby doll, or toy fireman.

Foot traffic always brought foot traffic. The grownups slowed as they crunched the snowy street. They cast an eye at the many temptations ranked behind Borislav&#8217;s windows. Then they would impulse-buy. A football scarf, maybe. A pack of tissues for a sneezy nose.    

Once again he was ahead of the game: the only kiosk in town with a fabrikator&#8230;.</blockquote>

Bit rough the first page or two, but gets better.

That cylindrical object you see pictured above is a roughly school-bus sized structure which was deployed into space in 1984. It orbited the Earth for five and a half years with nothing expected of it other than to float there, getting battered about by whatever the great black yonder saw fit to throw at it. You see, every inch of its outside surface was covered with Science. 57 separate experiments, mounted in 86 trays, involving the participation of â€œmore than 200 principal investigators from 33 private companies, 21 universities, seven NASA centers, nine Department of Defense laboratories and eight foreign countries.â€ Its purpose was to study the effects of space on a multitude of materials. Its name is the Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) and I am deeply in love with it. </blockquote>
