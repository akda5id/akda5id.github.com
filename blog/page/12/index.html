<blockquote>Since the late 1980s, computer scientists and engineers have been researching ways of embedding computational intelligence into the built environment. Looking beyond the model of personal computing, which placed the computer in the foreground of our attention, â€œubiquitousâ€ computing takes into account the social dimension of human environments and allows computers themselves to vanish into the background. No longer solely virtual, human interaction with and through computers becomes socially integrated and spatially contingent, as everyday objects and spaces are linked through networked computing.</blockquote>

<blockquote>I dropped into Quinto, the second-hand bookshop on Charing Cross Road. Granta was about to celebrate its 100th edition, and I wanted some early copies - those classic ones with writing by Richard Ford, John Berger, Martin Amis and Angela Carter. The man at the counter wasn&#8217;t impressed. &#8216;What&#8217;s Granta?&#8217;
	
I could have given him the usual: about how it was a river in Cambridge, or the upper part of one, and its name spawned a student magazine that began in 1889 and was revived in the late 1970s. I could have said that this magazine became home to some of the best writing in the English language, and was edited for half its life by a man, Bill Buford, described to me as &#8216;a crazy, inspiring, absolutely absurd lunatic&#8217;. But instead I said: &#8216;It&#8217;s a literary magazine, but it looks like a book.&#8217;</blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content">Ayaan Hirsi Ali in the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/07/opinion/07ali.html?ex=1354770000&en=e437cb676b9833c4&ei=5124&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink">NYT</a>:

<blockquote>
<p>It is often said that Islam has been &#8220;hijacked&#8221; by a small extremist group of radical fundamentalists. The vast majority of Muslims are said to be moderates.</p>

<p>But where are the moderates? Where are the Muslim voices raised over the terrible injustice of incidents like these? How many Muslims are willing to stand up and say, in the case of the girl from Qatif, that this manner of justice is appalling, brutal and bigoted - and that no matter who said it was the right thing to do, and how long ago it was said, this should no longer be done?</p>

<p>Usually, Muslim groups like the Organization of the Islamic Conference are quick to defend any affront to the image of Islam. The organization, which represents 57 Muslim states, sent four ambassadors to the leader of my political party in the Netherlands asking him to expel me from Parliament after I gave a newspaper interview in 2003 noting that by Western standards some of the Prophet Muhammad&#8217;s behavior would be unconscionable. A few years later, Muslim ambassadors to Denmark protested the cartoons of Muhammad and demanded that their perpetrators be prosecuted.</p>

<p>But while the incidents in Saudi Arabia, Sudan and India have done more to damage the image of Islamic justice than a dozen cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad, the organizations that lined up to protest the hideous Danish offense to Islam are quiet now&#8230; .</p>

<p>When a &#8220;moderate&#8221; Muslim&#8217;s sense of compassion and conscience collides with matters prescribed by Allah, he should choose compassion. Unless that happens much more widely, a moderate Islam will remain wishful thinking.</p>

<blockquote>
Divorce is not just a family matter. It exacts a serious toll on the environment by boosting the energy and water consumption of those who used to live together, according to a study by two Michigan State University researchers.

The analysis found that cohabiting couples and families around the globe use resources more efficiently than households that have split up. The researchers calculated that in 2005, divorced American households used between 42 and 61 percent more resources per person than before they separated, spending 46 percent more per person on electricity and 56 percent more on water.
</blockquote>

But be careful, as your partner may just reply &#8220;I&#8217;ve found someone new&#8221;:
<blockquote>&#8220;There&#8217;s strong evidence, which emerges clearly in this paper, that merging what otherwise would be separate households will reduce energy and other resource needs,&#8221; Cavanagh wrote in an e-mail. &#8220;The best advice to those who are miserable together is not, however, to avoid divorce for the sake of the environment, but to find someone else as quickly as possible.&#8221;</blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content">Andrew Blum:
<blockquote>â€œI think weâ€™re not too far off from recognizing that itâ€™s a moral imperative to add density to any place with a transit stop,â€ believes Christopher Leinberger, a fellow at the Brookings Institutionâ€”displaying plenty of the modernist brio and contempt for the souls of cities that Jacobs fought. But Iâ€™m tending to agree. We are wedging ourselves between a rock and a hard place: between the pleasures of medium-density living (Greenwich Village, Park Slope, Torontoâ€™s Annex) and the ecological necessity of even more density. When it comes to our homes, we are all justifiably afraid of change, especially when it feels like (or is) destruction. But we donâ€™t often pair that truth with another oft-repeated one: Our way of life is unsustainable. In North Americaâ€™s most beautiful urban places, we unfailingly fight every new tall building in the name of â€œquality of lifeâ€ and the â€œcharacter of the neighborhood.â€ We claim to have internalized the idea that itâ€™s all connected, that slowing the warming of the planet is a global project, but the nature in our backyards remains sacredâ€”often to the point, perhaps, of self-destruction.</blockquote>

The key question is how to keep the neighborhood even in high density living. Take a look at cities that have naturally grown with high density, like Hong Kong, and you will see it is possible.

  <div class="entry-content">The BBC is in trouble, political and economic. So what do they do? Make huge cuts in personnel and spending. Problem is that nearly everyone agrees that the reason they are in trouble is the quality of their programs are not where they should be, and of course the cuts are going to doom them. Some are standing up and shouting, is anyone listening?

<blockquote>We have had a series of cuts which will make it impossible to do what we have done up to now if they continue in the way they are continuing&#8230; And we are told there is going to be another massive cut over the next five years. The problem is, the BBC is in a whole range of things, it has many television channels, many radio stations, an internet presence and the rest of it. Maybe we are at a time when strategic judgments need to be made. If money has to be spent on the whole digital switchover for example, and building office blocks in Salford and all the rest of it, then maybe instead of cutting everything salami-sliced, then maybe we need to make judgments about the sort of things that we do, and maybe that does involve saying, reluctantly, and I hate to say this because it has been a wonderful institution, maybe we need to say perhaps we should be doing less better.</blockquote>
