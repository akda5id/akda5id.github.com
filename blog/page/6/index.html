  <div class="entry-content">Lewis Page in <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/06/20/mackay_on_carbon_free_uk/print.html">The Register</a>:
<blockquote>Professor David J C MacKay of the Cambridge University Department of Physics holds a PhD in computation from Cal Tech and a starred first in Physics, so we can take it that he knows his numbers. And, as he points out, numbers are typically lacking in current discussion around carbon emissions and energy use.

MacKay tells The Reg that he was first drawn into this field by the constant suggestion â€” from the Beeb, parts of the government etc â€” that we can seriously impact our personal energy consumption by doing such things as turning our TVs off standby or unplugging our mobile-phone chargers.

Anyone with even a slight grasp of energy units should know that this is madness. Skipping one bath saves a much energy as leaving your TV off standby for over six months. People who wash regularly, wear clean clothes, consume hot food or drink, use powered transport of any kind and live in warm houses have no need to worry about the energy they use to power their electronics; itâ€™s insignificant compared to the other things.</blockquote>

The article goes on to summarize some of the solution scenarios MacKay worked out for the UK, and as you would expect nuclear is the only one that is close to achievable.

<blockquote>Recorded sound had no greater friend than Tony Schwartz, the audio documentarian, advertising guru, media consultant, and exalted citizen of the aural universe, who passed away Saturday a few months shy of his 85th birthday. He&#8217;ll be forever linked to his best-known workâ€”the infamous &#8220;Daisy&#8221; ad from Lyndon Johnson&#8217;s 1964 re-election campaignâ€”but to many, Schwartz is beloved for sharing with the world his lifelong infatuation with the musicality of prosaic sounds.</blockquote> And Doug posted some great clips from his albums, go listen.

SB: This one&#8217;s called, &#8220;Bruce Schneier and the King of the Crabs.&#8221; It mostly must have really happened, too â€“ it&#8217;s how we lost Barbados, or Bermuda, or some island down there anyway.

GP: I don&#8217;t believe we have that one on file. But it would probably be Barbados, because that&#8217;s still a restricted zone. I don&#8217;t know why. I thought it was nuclear, though.

SB: Well, may well be I can shed some light on that. I personally don&#8217;t think this actually happened to Bruce Schneier, but that&#8217;s the way it was told to me, and it&#8217;s still worth telling. Story goes, ol&#8217; Bruce Schneier was vacationing on Barbados with his dog once. And they&#8217;d go out walking on the beach, as men and dogs often do.</blockquote>

<blockquote>At a handful of sites across the country, after a four-decade hiatus, psychedelic research is undergoing a quiet renaissance, thanks to scientists like Charles Grob who are revisiting the powerful mind-altering drugs of the 1960s in hopes of making them part of our therapeutic arsenal. Hallucinogens such as psilocybin, MDMA (better known as Ecstasy), and the most controversial of them all, LSD, are being tested as treatments for maladies that modern medicine has done little to assuage, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, drug dependency, obsessive-compulsive disorder, cluster headaches, and the emotional suffering of people with a terminal illness.

While Grobâ€™s study is not completeâ€”he has tested 11 out of a projected 12 volunteersâ€”patients seemed to have positive experiences. â€œNo one had a bad trip, and most derived some benefit,â€ he says. â€œIt lowered their anxiety, improved their mood and disposition, and imbued them with a greater acceptance of their situation and capacity to live in the moment and appreciate each day.â€</blockquote>

This is a fairly well written article that covers the basics of past psychedelics research, and the current minimal studies that are going on now. I have archived the article <a href="http://s3.ubernerd.org/blog/2008/05/Could_an_Acid_Trip_Cure_Your_OCD.html">here</a> because Discover&#8217;s site is completely broken in Safari, and hideously unusable in Firefox.

  <div class="entry-content">A different theory than the earlier posted <a href="http://da5id.org/tifi/2008/04/quantum-bounce-and-cosmic-recall/">Loop Quantum Gravity</a> (&#8220;quantum bounce&#8221;), though this article does touch on that idea in it&#8217;s sum up of previous research.

Sean M. Carroll in <a href="http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=the-cosmic-origins-of-times-arrow&amp;print=true">Scientific American Magazine</a>:
<blockquote>In the presence of dark energy, empty space is not completely empty. Fluctuations of quantum fields give rise to a very low temperatureâ€”enormously lower than the temperature of todayâ€™s universe but nonetheless not quite absolute zero. All quantum fields experience occasional thermal fluctuations in such a universe. That means it is not perfectly quiescent; if we wait long enough, individual particles and even substantial collections of particles will fluctuate into existence, only to once again disperse into the vacuum. (These are real particles, as opposed to the short-lived â€œvirtualâ€ particles that empty space contains even in the absence of dark energy.)

Among the things that can fluctuate into existence are small patches of ultradense dark energy. If conditions are just right, that patch can undergo inflation and pinch off to form a separate universe all its ownâ€”a baby universe. Our universe may be the offspring of some other universe.

Superficially, this scenario bears some resemblance to the standard account of inflation. There, too, we posit that a patch of ultradense dark energy arises by chance, igniting inflation. The difference is the nature of the starting conditions. In the standard account, the patch arose in a wildly fluctuating universe, in which the vast bulk of fluctuations produced nothing resembling inflation. It would seem to be much more likely for the universe to fluctuate straight into a hot big bang, bypassing the inflationary stage altogether. Indeed, as far as entropy is concerned, it would be even more likely for the universe to fluctuate straight into the configuration we see today, bypassing the past 14 billion years of cosmic evolution.

In our new scenario, the preexisting universe was never randomly fluctuating; it was in a very specific state: empty space. What this theory claimsâ€”and what remains to be provedâ€”is that the most likely way to create universes like ours from such a preexisting state is to go through a period of inflation, rather than fluctuating there directly. Our universe, in other words, is a fluctuation but not a random one.

Emit fo Worra
This scenario, proposed in 2004 by Jennifer Chen of the University of Chicago and me, provides a provocative solution to the origin of time asymmetry in our observable universe: we see only a tiny patch of the big picture, and this larger arena is fully time-symmetric. Entropy can increase without limit through the creation of new baby universes.

Best of all, this story can be told backward and forward in time. Imagine that we start with empty space at some particular moment and watch it evolve into the future and into the past. (It goes both ways because we are not presuming a unidirectional arrow of time.) Baby universes fluctuate into existence in both directions of time, eventually emptying out and giving birth to babies of their own. On ultralarge scales, such a multiverse would look statistically symmetric with respect to timeâ€”both the past and the future would feature new universes fluctuating into life and proliferating without bound. Each of them would experience an arrow of time, but half would have an arrow that was reversed with respect to that in the others.

The idea of a universe with a backward arrow of time might seem alarming. If we met someone from such a universe, would they remember the future? Happily, there is no danger of such a rendezvous. In the scenario we are describing, the only places where time seems to run backward are enormously far back in our pastâ€”long before our big bang. In between is a broad expanse of universe in which time does not seem to run at all; almost no matter exists, and entropy does not evolve. Any beings who lived in one of these time-reversed regions would not be born old and die youngâ€”or anything else out of the ordinary. To them, time would flow in a completely conventional fashion. It is only when comparing their universe to ours that anything seems out of the ordinaryâ€”our past is their future, and vice versa. But such a comparison is purely hypothetical, as we cannot get there and they cannot come here.</blockquote>
