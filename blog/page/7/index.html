More specifically, YouTomb continually monitors the most popular videos on YouTube for copyright-related takedowns.

The goal of the project is to identify how YouTube recognizes potential copyright violations as well as to aggregate mistakes made by the algorithm.</blockquote>

<blockquote>American writer Susan Sontag was terrified of death. She beat cancer in the 1970s, and again in the 1990s, but third time around she wasn&#8217;t so lucky. In a tender account of her final illness, her son David Rieff recalls how he colluded with his mother&#8217;s fantasy that she wasn&#8217;t dying - and what this ultimately cost him after she had gone.</blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content">Tomoko Otake for <a href="http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fl20060917x1.html">The Japan Times</a>
<blockquote>Nearly 300 spectators cheered wildly as disco music blared. A spotlight picked out two fighters approaching the ring to kick off a puroresu (prowrestling) event held recently in a Tokyo town hall. Then a female MC announced, in a startlingly high-pitched voice: &#8220;In the blue corner, E.T.! In the red corner, Arm Bomb Fujiwara!&#8221; Both wrestlers were physically handicapped and had to be helped or lifted into the ring. But when the starting bell rang, the men &#8211; both of them sitting and rolling around on the canvas &#8211; began punching each other with all the power and accuracy they could muster.

Blows landed thick and fast, and the crowd roared. Then Arm Bomb Fujiwara got his arm round E.T.&#8217;s neck and began to throttle him. As E.T.&#8217;s face reddened to puce and he started shaking, the referee called a halt to the bout and declared a win for Arm Bomb &#8211; who raised his fist high as the crowd laughed and shrieked.

That night, many of the dozen disabled wrestlers from the Doglegs group that staged the show in western Tokyo&#8217;s Shimokitazawa district looked truly fired up and fearless. In melodramatic contrast, the few able-bodied participants were wimps, including one going by the name of &#8220;Mushikera Goro (Worthless Goro)&#8221; who, according to the program, was a hikikomori (long-term stay-at-home recluse) with a big-time Oedipus complex. He lost out to 41-year-old &#8220;Anchi-teze&#8221; (Antithesis) Kitajima, the broad-shouldered nondisabled man who is also Doglegs&#8217; leader.

But why stage contests in which one or both participants are so clearly disadvantaged? What is it all about?</blockquote>

<blockquote>&#8220;That&#8217;s our intention &#8211; to make people think,&#8221; said Doglegs&#8217; leader and cofounder Kitajima &#8211; real name, Yukinori Kitajima &#8211; who makes a living not from running Doglegs but from writing fiction and computer-game scenarios.

Speaking after the two-hour event had ended, the father of two young girls said that over the past 15 years the group has performed around 70 times all over Japan, and once in South Korea. Then he explained: &#8220;We don&#8217;t want to show something for people to simply laugh at and walk away. You might get a laugh out of our matches at times, but we also want people to wonder what this all means. We want to give people a nasty aftertaste.&#8221;</blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content">In <a href="http://www.believermag.com/issues/200803/?read=interview_herzog">The Believer is a conversation</a> that took place at Brandeis University in the fall of 2007, moderated by Alice Arshalooys Kelikian. And this is the best conversation I have ever read:

<blockquote>ERROL MORRIS: Yeah. The intention is to put the audience in some kind of odd reality. [To moderator] Werner certainly shares this. Itâ€™s the perverse element in filmmaking. Werner in his â€œMinnesota Manifestoâ€ starts talking about ecstatic truth. I have no idea what heâ€™s talking about.

But what I do understand in his films is a kind of ecstatic absurdity, things that make you question the nature of reality, of the universe in which we live. We think we understand the world around us. We look at a Herzog film, and we think twice. And I always, always have revered that element. Ecstatic absurdity: itâ€™s the confrontation with meaninglessness.

I was talking with Ron Rosenbaum, a friend of mine, who had just finished a book on Shakespeare. We were talking about the meaning of meaninglessness. Is there such a thing? And I would say: yes. Wernerâ€™s work could be considered an extended essay on the meaning of meaninglessness.

WERNER HERZOG: Thank you, yes. It feels good to hear that. [Laughter]</blockquote>
Later:<blockquote>WH: [&#8230;] And I said that we were going to do a film there in Plainfield, and that really upset Errol a lot. He thought I was a thief without loot. This was his country, his territory, his Plainfield, and I shot in Plainfield. I shot a film, Stroszek, which I think is forgotten and forgiven by now, and we can maintain friendship over this now.

EM: I told Werner: For you to steal a character or a story isnâ€™t real theft. But to steal a landscape, that is a very, very serious crime.

WH: I understand that. I take it to heart, but there actually is a film out there, and we canâ€™t take it off the map.

EM: Itâ€™s a very good film.

WH: It has a beautiful end with a dancing chicken, and I really like it.

EM: Yes.</blockquote>

Side note: WTF does nyt think it is doing with the video features? You can&#8217;t have your average print journalist produce a video (though they seem to do fine moving to the radio docu style as seen in the &#8220;audio slide shows&#8221;).

Thomas H. Maugh II | <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-hofmann30apr30,1,1408816,full.story">Los Angeles Times Staff Writer</a>:
<blockquote>But Hofmann&#8217;s life had already been altered. LSD and the other psychoactive drugs &#8220;changed my life, insofar as they provided me with a new concept about what reality is,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Before, I had believed there was only one reality: the reality of everyday life.

&#8220;Under LSD, however, I entered into realities which were as real and even more real than the one of everyday.&#8221; He also &#8220;became aware of the wonder of creation, the magnificence of nature and of the plant and animal kingdom. I became very sensitive to what will happen to all this and all of us.&#8221;
